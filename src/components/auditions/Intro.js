      The European Spirit of Youth Orchestra (ESYO) offers a high-level
      pre-professional training to selected young musicians (aged 13 – 23) from
      all European countries and other non-European countries. The ESYO Project
      aims to give our musicians the opportunity to gain experience with
      symphonic repertoire as a member of a unique international symphony
      orchestra and contributes to a better personal and artistic growth. The
      annual course is made up of several training periods which include
      intensive orchestra rehearsals, masterclasses, chamber music workshop and
      concert appearances around Europe leaded by our international acclaimed
      faculty, by ESYO Artistic Director and Principal Conductor Igor Coretti
      Kuret assisted by the conductor Nenad Petković.
