                <span className="beCareful">What is music?</span>
                It is a question that has always haunted the minds of musicians,
                scientists, sociologists, philosophers, all of us and which to
                date has not had an answer. For me, music is spiritual energy,
                which helps to relate to people and the universe.

                  The orchestra is a school of democracy.
                </span>
                All its components are important, but none are irreplaceable. To
                play together with others you must first learn to listen. In
                every orchestra, as in life, the condition for being able to
                &quot;dialogue&quot; is to listen to others and relate to the
                whole. Living this experience can help discover one&#39;s
                personality, learn to recognize the concepts of equality, mutual
                respect and responsibility for others and for the environment.

              <em>
                For this reason, I believe it is very important and useful to
                play in an orchestra, even more so if it is a symphonic and
                international one, starting this practice, possibly, already in
                adolescence. <br />

                  The idea of creating an international youth symphony orchestra
                </span>
                it matured following personal musical experiences, lived during
                the (musical) growth path. The childhood memory of my
                &quot;first time&quot; in the orchestra is still alive in me.
                What an emotion! Just as the memory of when, already graduated
                in violin, I was sitting at the third lectern of the Italian
                Youth Orchestra, then directed by Maestro Riccardo Muti, is
                still alive. An indescribable experience! It was my
                &quot;electrocution&quot;. The one that had a decisive influence
                on my subsequent choices, first as a student and then as a
                professional musician.

                </span>
                , in a multicultural and international environment, they then
                convinced me how necessary it was to propose them again in a
                project to be offered to young musicians as an opportunity for
                personal growth and a complementary and professionalizing
                musical training moment. An international symphony orchestra as
                a tool for the training of young people (musicians). A project
                that I managed to create starting from my city, Trieste, which
                has always been a crossroads of different peoples and cultures,
                involving musicians, musical and governmental institutions from
                several European countries.
                <br />
                <span className="beCareful">Music is good for everyone.</span>
                Experiencing it and playing it together with others is still a
                privilege for a few, but one that I hope will soon become
                practiced by many, thanks also to experiences like the ESYO that
                young musicians will not be able to forget.

              <span className="beCareful">Igor Coretti Kuret</span> is an
              Italian Slovene violinist, pedagogue and orchestra director,
              internationally acknowledged for his great communication skills
              with young people. He is born and grew up in Trieste, a city with
              a very rich musical and cultural environment that characterized
              Central Europe in the last century, and an important commercial
              port, a hinge between the Mediterranean and continental Europe,
              which has always been a crossroads of peoples and a meeting point
              between the Latin, Slavic and German cultural worlds. <br />
              His name is linked to the ESYO orchestra, considered by many to be
              an example of musical excellence and an intercultural meeting
              between young people. For his services to the youth orchestra he
              created, he was awarded the Medal of Honor of the Central European
              Initiative and an award from the Municipality of Trieste. <br />
              All the projects he created promote meeting, friendship, dialogue,
              and collaboration between peoples. Some have also been recognized
              by the highest European institutions, such as the Culture
              Commission of the European Union and the Presidency of the
              European Parliament. With the &quot;Gorizia&quot; project
              conceived in 1994 he was the winner of the competition organized
              by the International Institute for Cultural Management of Salzburg
              in collaboration and with the patronage of the European Council
              and the Austrian Ministry of Culture. The “Drums of Peace”
              project, conceived together with the journalist and writer Paolo
              Rumiz, obtained the President of the Republic Medal. <br />{" "}
              Currently Maestro Coretti Kuret, in addition to exercising the
              artistic direction of the ESYO Project and being the artistic
              contact for the SGME, in the international field often holds the
              role of guest conductor of European orchestras, presides over
              juries of international competitions in Italy and abroad, teaches
              violin at the ICMA-UWC ADRIATIC in Duino near Trieste, holds
              masterclasses and workshops for young violinists and chamber music
              ensembles, and training seminars for violin and ensemble music
              teachers.
