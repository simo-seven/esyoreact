              The European Spirit of Youth Orchestra (ESYO) is a symphonic
              ensemble that, through its sound, captures the European spirit of
              the youth. It is the exemplary proof that the European dream is
              possible, youthful, and has a symphonic soul that resonates
              perfectly in harmony, thanks to the diversity of its voices,
              cultures, and traditions.

            <p className="text-justify">
              Since 1994, ESYO has been selecting and bringing together
              approximately 70 young musicians committed to excellence each
              year, aged between 11 and 19, from 18 European countries. In most
              cases, these are musicians with no prior experience in a symphony
              orchestra, who quickly become a close-knit and cohesive ensemble,
              becoming a symbol of uniqueness in the international concert
              scene. Selected by Maestro Igor Coretti Kuret, the creator and
              conductor of ESYO, they live and study in the conservatories and
              music schools of their respective countries. They are then invited
              and hosted by the School for Young European Musicians (SGME)
              during intensive rehearsals for the concert tour preparation, led
              by experienced teachers and professors from the finest European
              orchestras.
            </p>
            <p className="text-justify">
              More than 2.500 young musicians selected, 4.000 music teachers and
              tutors involved in selections, as well as about 50 outstanding
              professional musicians preparing young “colleagues” from Albania,
              Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech
              Rep., Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro,
              Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden and
              Ukraine, on occasion of intensive rehearsals and concert tours,
              since 1994. Some former members of the orchestra are now part of
              prestigious European and American orchestras, such as the
              Orchestra of La Scala, the Hamburg Opera Orchestra, the National
              Mexican Orchestra, and others.

              They are extraordinary young individuals who devote their school
              holidays to studying and rehearsing classical music masterpieces
              together. While they all share the immense pleasure of living
              through music, they also differ in language, culture, and country
              of origin. These are young people aged between 11 and 19, enrolled

              The cultural association School for Young European Musicians SGME,
              founded in Trieste in 1991 following the outbreak of the war in
              the Balkans, has as its main goal to promote dialogue and respect
              for the diverse European cultures. It contributes to the
              development of EU neighborhood and enlargement policies, fostering
              European integration through the organization of cultural and
              social events actively involving talented young musicians from

              Orchestra ESYO, aimed at young musicians between the ages of 11
              and 19 and selected annually in Eastern, Central European, and

              experience a unique artistic growth, both professionally and
              personally. In addition to musical training in a multicultural
              environment, musicians are encouraged to strive for excellence and
              acquire new skills, including the essential ability to listen,
              crucial for playing in a symphonic ensemble.

              For thirty years, ESYO's activity has been characterized by a
              pronounced international dimension. By creating a significant

              transnational mobility of students and professionals in the field,
              including orchestra conductors and teachers. Furthermore, through
              public concerts, it supports and spreads among European citizens
              living in urban, peripheral, and rural areas, the cultural and
              symphonic musical heritage together with the values of integration
              and social inclusion.
